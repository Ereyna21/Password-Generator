Hello, hope you had a happy holidays.

so i started by naming my variables. 

then i inputed all my characters

i used the var and let for my variable declarations

i was able to get my messages on screen and everything to work in console.

however i was only able to get zeros to pop up in the password generator.

I used (mdn web doc) https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/, the xpert learning assistant in boot camp spot. 

I was also refering back to the lesson assesments and recorded zoom class recordings.

Here is my git hublink as well https://github.com/Ereyna21/seo-Refactor-3
